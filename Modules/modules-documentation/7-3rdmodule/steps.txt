create a new module called ui
add module descriptor file.
cut the ui package from commons package and move it to the newly created  ui module.

cleanup the previous module-info files for modules.


so the solution is that 

1. commons module - HAS NO DEPENDENCY
2. db module - has dependency on commons module and sqlite library.
3. ui module - has dependency on the commons and db module


in this way, each thing is referenced in minimal numbers and we have no cyclic dependency problem.
