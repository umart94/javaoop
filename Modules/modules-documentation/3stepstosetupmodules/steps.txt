project from existing sources


jdk 11 and later do not have javafx bundled with them

so install jdk9.0.1

suppose we have a <9 jdk project

we can import it in intelliJ and make it use jdk9 with module features
and intellij will configure the project.

verify that libraries have been added
verify that project jdk level is at 9
verify that module jdk is jdk 9
verify that language level is set to 9 - Modules.



before jdk 9 we had to add the library as a project library

now we have to add library in module -> dependencies -> add jar file -> set it to compile.



now :
if project level is set to jdk 9
module level set to jdk 9
language level set to jdk 9
and all dependencies and libraries are added AS MODULE DEPENDENCIES.

then this project will run successfully..



otherwise it will give exception for any one of the dependencies that we added

for e.g no suitable driver found. for jdb sqlite.

so to fix that, add the dependency jar file to modoule library dependency instead of the project dependency.
