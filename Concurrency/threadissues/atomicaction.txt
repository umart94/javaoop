when a thread is running, it can be suspended when its in the middle of doing something

if a thread calls the system.out.println method , it can be suspended in the middle of executing the method it may have evaluated the argument thats being passed.
but its suspended before it can print the result.

it can be partway through evaluating the argument when its suspended essentially , system.out.println is not an atomic action.

an atomic action cannot be suspended in the middle of being executed it either completes or it doesnt happen at all. once a thread starts to run an atomic action
we can be confident that it wont be suspended until it has completed the action.
